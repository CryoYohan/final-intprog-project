## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 🔙 Backend Testing

**API Testing using Postman**  
```http
POST http://localhost:4000/accounts/register
```
Run Unit Tests

```bash
npm test
```
Ensure package.json is properly configured for testing

### 🎨 Frontend Testing
✅ Using Fake Backend
Ensure FakeBackendInterceptor is enabled in app.module.ts

Run the development server:

```bash
ng serve
```
### 🔄 Using Real Backend
Remove FakeBackendInterceptor from app.module.ts

Update environment.apiUrl with your actual backend URL

Run the development server:

```bash
ng serve
```
🧪 Run Frontend Unit Tests
```bash
